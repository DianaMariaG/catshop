                    <p class="long-text">
                        The Siberian cat is a medium-sized, semi-longhaired cat that is both breathtaking to 
                        behold and an affectionate pet. Siberian is a forest cat native to snowy Russia, where 
                        it needed its luxurious triple coat to protect against cold. This breed has a delightful 
                        personality—outgoing, affectionate, friendly, and energetic—making it an exceptional 
                        feline companion. They enjoy the company of other cats and even dogs and are good with 
                        gentle, respectful children. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="long-text">
                        Siberian cats hail from Russia, where they are cherished as a national treasure. It&sbquo;s hard 
                        to say just how long Siberian cats have existed in Russia, but based on Russian fairy 
                        tales and children&sbquo;s books, they have likely been around for hundreds of years and maybe 
                        as long as 1,000 years.   
                    </p>
                    <p class="long-text">
                        Siberian cats were described in a book called "Our Cats and All About Them" by Harrison 
                        Weir, which was originally published in 1889. The United States got their first glimpse 
                        of the Siberian cat after the Cold War thawed in the 1990s, and it was love at first sight. 
                        The Siberian cat is recognized by the Cat Fanciers&sbquo; Association and The International Cat 
                        Association.    
                    </p>
                    <p class="long-text">
                        The Siberian cat is intelligent and exceptionally playful. The breed is known to be slow 
                        to mature, taking as long as five years to graduate from kitten-like antics. This means 
                        the Siberian cat is a lot of fun to have around.
                        This breed loves to climb, explore, and play. To keep your Siberian cat mentally stimulated 
                        and physically enriched, expose it to a variety of fun toys and play lots of games.    
                    </p>
                    <p class="long-text">
                        Work with your veterinarian to choose the best food for your Siberian cat. Although dry food 
                        is convenient, canned food contains fewer carbs and has a lot of extra moisture. Most cats 
                        don&sbquo;t drink enough water, which can affect their overall health, including their kidney 
                        health. Feed measured amounts of food at scheduled times, two to three times a day. Don&sbquo;t 
                        leave food out all day, as this can contribute to an overweight cat.    
                    </p>
                    <p class="long-text">
                        Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that causes thickening of the heart 
                        muscle, is more prevalent in certain breeds, including Siberians. Mutations of several 
                        cardiac (heart) genes have been identified in some cats with this disease, which suggests 
                        that genetics plays a role.
